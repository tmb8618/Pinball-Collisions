So this is Ian Furry's and Tyler Brogna's pitiful pinball attempt.
Like most projects of mine, long hours of work
were finally defeated by my own incompetence.

Either way, the performace of pinball is entierly dependant
 on if the .swf is in a good mood. Pulling the spring too hard
back will cause catastropic weirdness, and pulling it a
 short ways demonstrates its springy properites.

To get the ball to the actual stage, pull the spring
all the way back let the ball fall off the stage.
It will respawn at the top, and begin bouncing all over things.

The ball does not consistantly bounce off of the first bumper
it collides with. I have no explaination for this
event, and it infuriates me to no end.

I know by this point im only trying to scrape off a few more points,
 but please don't immedately dismiss the strange things
i cannot explain. Night.
